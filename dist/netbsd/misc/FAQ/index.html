<p><hr><h3><a name="where_to_download_kernel_source">
	Where to download kernel source
</a></h3>
<h4><a name="official_release_kernel_source">Official release
source</a></h4> The kernel source for a given release is held in the
gzipped tarfile 'source/sets/syssrc.tgz' under the main directory for
that release. For example NetBSD 1.3.2 kernel source is in the file:
<pre>   <a
href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.3.2/source/sets/syssrc.tgz">/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.3.2/source/sets/syssrc.tgz</a></pre>
If you have a <a href="http://www.netbsd.com">NetBSD CD-Rom</a>, the
'source/sets/syssrc.tgz' file should be included. The source can be
extracted anywhere, though the traditional location is inside /usr/src.
To extract use "<b><tt>cd / ; tar xvzpf &lt;FILENAME&gt;</tt></b>".
<p> <h4>'Bleeding edge' -current source, for the adventurous only!</h4>
The latest kernel sources are available from ftp.netbsd.org or one of
the mirrors in the directory <a
href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/src/sys/">/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/src/sys/</a>.<br>
To compile a kernel you should download the following from <a
href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/tar_files/src/">
/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/tar_files/src</a>:  <ul>
   <li><a
   href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/tar_files/src/config.tar.gz">config.tar.gz</a>
   (Source for the 'config' program) <li><a
   href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/tar_files/src/sys.tar.gz">sys.tar.gz</a>
   (Complete kernel source for all architectures) </ul> You should
first build and install the 'config' program, in case it has changed
since the version you are running. Since -current is on the active edge
of NetBSD development, there can be <a
href="#problems_compiling_a_current_kernel">problems compiling a
-current kernel</a>. You are recommended to use source from an <a
href="#official_release_kernel_source">Official Release</a> until you
are familiar with the configuration process.

<p><hr><h3><a name="how_to_build_a_kernel">
	How to build a kernel
</a></h3>
<ol>
    <li>Download and extract the kernel source (see
	<a href="#where_to_download_kernel_source">Where to download kernel
	source</a>).
 <p><li>"<b><tt>cd /sys/arch/&lt;ARCH&gt;/conf</tt></b>"<br>
	where &lt;ARCH&gt; is your machine's architecture such as 'i386',
	'sparc', 'mac68k'.
 <p><li>"<b><tt>cp GENERIC &lt;MYCONF&gt;</tt></b>"<br>
	where &lt;MYCONF&gt; is your name for this configuration. You could use
	your hostname, the machine type, or even your first name. Keep to
	letters, numbers, and _ characters.
 <p><li><b>Edit &lt;MYCONF&gt;</b><br>
	Initially you can skip this stage.
	You can remove drivers for CPU types, hardware, and devices you do
	not have or use, or even enable options, such as on i386 commenting out
	the 'pc0' line and enabling the 'vt0' to gain virtual consoles.
	A good start to determing what hardware drivers you definitely need to
	keep is to read the output of "<b><tt>dmesg</tt></b>" or
	"<b><tt>dmesg | grep ' at '</tt></b>".  For evey line containing
	'&lt;XXX&gt; at &lt;YYY&gt;' you need to keep the entries for both
	&lt;XXX&gt; and &lt;YYY&gt;. You should also read "<b><tt>man 4
	options</tt></b>"
	for information on the different kernel configuration options.
 <p><li>"<b><tt>config &lt;MYCONF&gt;</tt></b>"<br>
	This will generate the kernel build directory for &lt;MYCONF&gt;.
 <p><li>"<b><tt>cd ../compile/&lt;MYCONF&gt;</tt></b>"<br>
	Change to the kernel build directory.
 <p><li>"<b><tt>make depend</tt></b>"<br>
	This generates a '.depend' file that enables the make program to what
	needs to be rebuilt (at this point it will be everything!).
 <p><li>"<b><tt>make</tt></b>"<br>
	This will compile the kernel. If all goes well you will be left with a
	'netbsd' kernel. This may take some significant time if you are on a
	VAX, very little time on a big Alpha, and somewhere inbetween for the
	rest of us.
 <p><li>"<b><tt>mv /netbsd /netbsd.old ; mv netbsd /</tt></b>"<br>
	This saves your current kernel, (_very_ important), and moves the new
	kernel ready to be booted.
 <p><li>"<b><tt>reboot</tt></b>"<br>
	This should reboot using your new kernel - the boot messages should
	contain a line of the form:
	'NetBSD &lt;VERSION&gt; (&lt;MYCONF&gt;) #0: &lt;COMPILE_DATE&gt;

 <p><li><b>If you have any problems:</b><br>
	You should boot your 'netbsd.old' kernel in single user mode. The
	procedure varies from port to port depending on the boot procedure,
	but on i386 it would be:
	<ol>
	    <li><b>Press <tt>SPACE</tt> when the first NetBSD message appears</b></li>
	    <li>"<b><tt>boot -s netbsd.old</tt></b>"</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	Then swap your kernel back:
	<ol>
	    <li>"<b><tt>fsck /</tt></b>"</li>
	    <li>"<b><tt>mount /</tt></b>"</li>
	    <li>"<b><tt>mv netbsd.old netbsd</tt></b>"</li>
	    <li>"<b><tt>exit</tt></b>"</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
</ol>

<p><hr><h3><a name="problems_compiling_a_current_kernel">
	Problems compiling a -current kernel
</a></h3>
The first point to note is you should subscribe to the
<a href="../MailingLists/index.html#current-users">current-users</a> mail list.
Tracking -current without reading current-users is akin to driving in the dark
without any lights. You have been warned :).<p>
It is always worth downloading the latest
<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/tar_files/src/config.tar.gz">config.tar.gz</a>, compiling, installing and rerunning on your config
file - config changes reasonably frequently between releases.

<p><hr><h3><a name="how_to_debug_a_kernel_crash_dump">
	How to debug a kernel crash dump
</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Ensure you have <a href="#how_to_build_a_kernel">built a kernel</a> with
    DEBUG enabled in the config file.
<li>"<b><tt>gdb netbsd.gdb</tt></b>" (in kernel compile directory).
<li>"<b><tt>target kcore /var/crash/netbsd.0.core</tt></b>" at the gdb prompt.
</ul>
You can use the usual gdb commands, such as 't'.

<p><hr><h3><a name="plip_support">
	Is PLIP (Parallel Line IP) supported
</a></h3>
There are patches from Martin Husemann which add PLIP support to
NetBSD/i386, submitted as <a
href="http://www.NetBSD.org/cgi-bin/query-pr-single.pl?number=1278">PR 1278</a>.
The patches at the end of the PR should apply to the NetBSD 1.3.2 source tree.

<ul>
<li>Ensure you have <a href="#how_to_build_a_kernel">built a kernel</a> with
    DEBUG enabled in the config file.
<li>"<b>gdb netbsd.gdb</b>" (in kernel compile directory).
<li>"<b>target kcore /var/crash/netbsd.0.core</b>" at the gdb prompt.
</ul>
You can use the usual gdb commands, such as 't'.

<p><hr><h3><a name="how_to_add_a_kernel_to_a_boot_floppy">
	How to add a kernel to a boot floppy
</a></h3>
Some ports are already setup to build a boot floppy by
"<b><tt>cd /usr/src/distrib/<em>&lt;ARCH&gt;</em>/floppies ; make </tt></b>".
(You may need to build the INSTALL kernel manually before running this.
If you have an existing <b>boot.fs</b> image you can replace the kernel with:
<ol>
<li><b><tt>vnconfig -c vnd0 boot.fs</tt></b>
<li><b><tt>mount /dev/vnd0a /mnt</tt></b>
<li><b><tt>gzip -c -9 &lt; netbsd &gt; /mnt/netbsd.gz</tt></b>
<li><b><tt>umount /mnt</tt></b>
<li><b><tt>vnconfig -u vnd0</tt></b>
</ol>
This assumes you have "<tt>pseudo-device vnd</tt>" in your kernel config file,
and a ready to use kernel.

<p><hr><h3><a name="precompiled_packages">
	Where to find precompiled programs
</a></h3>
NetBSD 1.3 and later support a <a
href="../Documentation/netbsd/packages.html">'package'</a> collection for many
items of third party software. Precompiled binaries are available at
<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages">
ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages</a>, or a mirror thereof
(each NetBSD port has its own subdirectory). An <a
href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/README.html">
HTML index</a> is also available.<p>
To install packages you can either:
<ul>
<li>Copy a package file to your machine and run
"<b><tt>pkg_add&nbsp;<i>package.tgz</i></tt></b>"
<li>Install direct from the ftp site.
For example, to install pine on a NetBSD/sparc 1.3 system:
"<b><tt>pkg_add&nbsp;ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/1.3/sparc/All/pine-3.96.tgz</tt></b>".
</ul>

<p><hr><h3><a name="packages">
	How to build/download programs
</a></h3>
NetBSD 1.3 and later support a <a
href="../Documentation/netbsd/packages.html">'package'</a> collection
that enables freely available third-party software to be built
easily on NetBSD hosts. Once the software has been built, it is
manipulated with the pkg_* tools so that installation and
de-installation, printing of an inventory of all installed packages
and retrieval of one-line comments or more verbose descriptions
are simple.
<p><a href="#precompiled_packages">Precompiled binaries</a>
for various architectures are also available.

<p><hr><h3><a name="unlimit">
	Compiling fails with '<b>virtual memory exhausted</b>'
</a></h3>
Try "<b><tt>unlimit datasize</tt></b>".<p>
NetBSD sets resource limits on a per process basis. The current values can
be displayed with "<b><tt>limit</tt></b>", and set with
"<b><tt>limit&nbsp;<em>resource</em>&nbsp;<em>value</em></tt></b>", or
unlimited with "<b><tt>unlimit&nbsp;<em>resource</em></tt></b>". More
details are available on the <b>getrlimit(2)</b> manual page
("<b><tt>man getrlimit</tt></b>").

<p><hr><h3><a name="unable_to_run_x">
	Unable to run X - '<b>xinit: not found</b>'
</a></h3>
You need /usr/X11R6/bin in your path. As root add
'<b><tt>set path = ( $path /usr/X11R6/bin )</tt></b>' to /etc/csh.cshrc, and
start a new shell.

<a name="ldconfig_and_x">&nbsp;</a> <!-- XXX Can go away sometime -->
<p><hr><h3><a name="shared_libraries_and_x">
'X programs fail with '<b>lib<em>XXXX</em>.so.<em>NN</em>: No such file...</b>'
</a></h3>
As root, edit /etc/ld.so.conf and add the line:
<pre>
    /usr/X11R6/lib
</pre>
while you are there you should probably ensure it also contains:
<pre>
    /usr/pkg/lib
</pre>
<em>(You <b>are</b> using the
<a href="../Documentation/netbsd/packages.html">NetBSD
packages system</a> for adding additional programs?)</em>.<br>
Then run "<b><tt>ldconfig -v</tt></b>", among the output you should see lines
of the form: 'Adding /usr/X11R6/lib/libXIE.so.6.0'.
<p>
<b>What are shared libraries?</b><br>
On order to save both disk and memory space most NetBSD ports use 'shared
libraries'. This allows one copy of each library (libXmu.so.6.0) to be loaded
into memory for multiple programs (xterm, fvwm2, etc). The standard system
shared libraries live in /usr/lib, but NetBSD needs to be told where to find
any additional libraries (such as those for X applications). To do this
the should be added to '/etc/ld.so.conf'.

<p><hr><h3><a name="xconsole">
	Console output (such as from 'su') garbles X display.
</a></h3>
The system is outputting a line to the console indicating something has
happened (such as 'su'). You should really run xconsole or
one 'xterm -C' to capture this console output.
<p>
You may need to ensure your kernel is compiled with the following enabled:
<pre>	options  UCONSOLE  # allow anyone to steal the virtual console</pre>
See <a href="#how_to_build_a_kernel">How to build a kernel</a> for
details on how to build your own kernels.

<p><hr><h3><a name="unable_to_locate_xm">
	Compiling X programs fail - unable to locate libXm
</a></h3>
Xm does not come with the standard X11 environment. It is part of 
<a href="http://www.camb.opengroup.org/desktop/motif/">Motif</a>, which
is a commercial graphical user interface.<p>
A freeware implementation of Motif called
<a href="http://www.lesstif.org/">Lesstif</a> is also available.

<p><hr><h3><a name="unable_to_locate_xpm">
	Compiling X programs fail - unable to locate xpm.h
</a></h3>
xpm.h is part of the X PixMap library, used by many programs to allow more
multi (than two) colour icons. It is available as part of the
<a href="../Documentation/netbsd/packages.html">NetBSD packages collection</a>.

<p><hr><h3><a name="problems_becoming_root">
	Problems logging in as, or 'su'ing to, root
</a></h3>
This covers a number of possible problems:
<ul>
    <li>Unable to login directly as root<br>
	NetBSD will only allow direct root login on terminals marked as
	'secure' in /etc/ttys. To be able to login directly as root across the
	network you will need to add 'secure' to the end of every network
	terminal line. For those who prefer not to have to edit each line you
	can (as root) type:<br>
	<dl>
	<dd>
	<b><tt>cd /etc<br>
	cp ttys ttys.orig<br>
	cat ttys.orig | sed 's/network$/network secure/' &gt; ttys</tt></b>.
	</dl>
    <p><li>Unable to 'su' to root<br>
	NetBSD checks the contents of the 'wheel' group in /etc/group for any
	attempt to su to root. If it is empty (wheel:*:0:) then anyone
	with the correct password can su to root. Otherwise it should be
	a comma separated (no spaces!) list of the permitted accounts.
    <p><li>Unable to 'su' to anyone<br>
        Type "<b><tt>ls -l /usr/bin/su</tt></b>". The first 'word' on the
	output should be '-r-sr-xr-x'. If it is anything else (such as
	'-r-xr-xr-x'). Type (as root) "<b><tt>chmod 4555 /usr/bin/su</tt></b>".
	The 's' in that position
	indicates it is a 'setuid' binary, which in this case allows 'su' to
	run with root privileges.<br>
	This problem can be caused by not giving the '-p' (preserve
	permissions) flag to tar when extracting the distribution. If this was
	the case then re-extract all the tarfiles (except etc.tar.gz) as
	various other utilities will also be broken.
</ul>

<p><hr><h3><a name="how_to_add_something_to_your_path">
	How to add something to your path
</a></h3>
For example, to add /usr/X11R6/bin to your path, edit the file <em>.login</em>
in your home directory and add the following:<br>
<b><tt>set path = ( /usr/X11R6/bin $path )</tt></b><br>
This only works for the C-shell (<em>csh</em>), and derivatives such as
<em>tcsh</em>.

<p><hr><h3><a name="setting_something_for_all_users">
	Setting something for all users
</a></h3>
You can set something for all users by adding it to one of the following files:
<ul>
<li><b><tt>/etc/csh.cshrc</tt></b><br>
    This is run every time a new shell is opened, before any
    <b><tt>.cshrc</tt></b> in the user's home directory.
<li><b><tt>/etc/csh.login</tt></b><br>
    This is run when the user logs in, after anything in
    <b><tt>/etc/csh.cshrc</tt></b>, but before any <b><tt>.login</tt></b>
    in the user's home directory.
<li><b><tt>/etc/csh.logout</tt></b><br>
    This is run when the user logs out, before any <b><tt>.logout</tt></b> in
    the user's home directory.
</ul>

<p><hr><h3><a name="rebuilding_dev">
	Rebuilding /dev
</a></h3>
The /dev directory contains the necessary device files for accessing hardware
and pseudo devices. If it becomes damaged, much strangeness can ensue.<br>
To rebuild the /dev directory, you should first boot single user (it should
be possible to perform while multiuser, but not recommended), then:
<ul>
<b><tt>
<li>mkdir /newdev
<li>cd /newdev
<li>cp /dev/M* .
<li>sh MAKEDEV all
<li>cd /
<li>mv dev olddev; mv newdev dev
<li>rm -r olddev
</tt></b>
</ul>


<p><hr><h3><a name="running_appletalk">
	Running Appletalk
</a></h3>
NetBSD supports 'netatalk', which enables unix machines to communicate with
appletalk machines over ethernet (but not localtalk). This allows MacOS
machines to read filesystems and print to printers via a NetBSD machine, and
for the NetBSD machine to print to AppleTalk printers.
The necessary source is available on ftp.netbsd.org (or mirrors) in
<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/misc/netatalk/">
/pub/NetBSD/misc/netatalk</a>.

<p><hr><h3><a name="connecting_a_ups">
	Connecting a UPS to a NetBSD system
</a></h3>
Connecting one is trivial, but monitoring it such that the NetBSD can shut down
cleanly when the power is about to fail requires a little more:<br>
Simon J. Gerraty has a page on using a
<a href="http://www.quick.com.au/sjg/apcmon.html">APC Smart-UPS</a>.
If you are writing your own software to talk to the UPS you will probably need
to set the softcar flag via tcsetattr(). Wolfgang Rupprecht has researched the
field briefly:
<dl>
<dd>
There two different types of UPS interfaces, sometimes both are
available on the same UPS. The 9-pin connector on the UPS is never
a wired up as a normal PC-style rs-232.  At best its a three-wire
rs-232 interface, with the pins rearanged just to keep things
interesting.  At worst its a contact closure signal that is not
even at the rs-232 signalling voltages and one must use a funny
cable with level-translators in it to convert the voltages to
something the rs-232 port can even see transitions on.  The signal
from the latter type of interface can only send out a one-bit
(normal / powerfail) signal.  It must be run into some modem-control
line such as DCD and is then detected via a program that checks
the status of that modem control line.  Unless one is careful, its
possible to confuse the modem-control-line-only cable that come
with some UPS's as a real rs-232 cable.
<p>
Poking around APC web page, and a few promising altavista hits
revealed that they have 3 basic interfaces.  Low end UPS's ("back
UPS") have only the modem-control line type interface.  The two high
end lines ("Back UPS Pro", "Smart UPS") have both combination modem
control line and 3-wire rs-232 signals available.  In both cases one
needs to use one of two special cables.  The cable for the modem
control line interface has transistors and diodes in it to do the
level shifting (and power grabbing from some of the other wires).  It's
a real kludge, with the word UGLY coming to mind as the correct
modifier.  The second type of cable will get the UPS talking serially,
but some of the 3-rd party docs indicated that the UPS will only talk
if you send 2 stop bits.  The protocols don't appear to be officially
documented and the back-UPS pro and smart UPS appear to talk different
serial line protocols.  Only the back-UPS pro line appears to have any
3-rd party support, and many of the details of the protocol are only
guessed at.
<p>
Competitors all seem to have similar offerings (modem control line
only, and proprietary serial line protocols with special cables).  In
no case could I find someone with an openly documented standard.

<p><hr><h3><a name="hash_map_Alias0">
	What does '<b>hash map "Alias0":unsafe map file /etc/aliases: No such
	file or directory</b>' mean?
</a></h3>
You can fix this by typing '<b><tt>newaliases</tt></b>' as root.<br>
Sendmail reports this when the aliases file is not present. Note that
sendmail actually uses /etc/aliases.db (which is built from /etc/aliases), so
the error message can be a little misleading. This should only really be
noticed in NetBSD 1.3 - other versions have a different /etc/sendmail.cf which
instructs sendmail to automatically rebuild /etc/aliases.db as needed.
If you are running NetBSD 1.3 you should probably upgrade to
