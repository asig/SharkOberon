   and it may only be modified by written agreement between you and ARM.

   other representation by any person.

   or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreement shall not be
   affected thereby.

   The failure by ARM to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement,
   unless waived in writing shall not constitute a waiver of ARM's rights

   future.
