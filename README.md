# SharkOberon

This repository contains _SharkOberon_, my diploma thesis at ETH Zurich from 1998/1999.

SharkOberon is an implementation of [Oberon System 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_(operating_system)) for the  
Development of an Oberon System 3 for the [SHARK Network Computer](https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102711028).

SharkOberon boots over the network using standard Internet protocols (TFTP) and includes development tools as well as basic Internet tools. A RAM-disk is used for local storage. It also support soft floating point operations and the use of a 2-button mouse.

The implementation is based on Native Oberon V2.3.2 and the Oberon-1-Compiler for the Ceres.

Instructions on how to build and run SharkOberon can be found in [this readme](dist/readme.txt)
